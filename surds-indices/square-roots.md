# Square Roots

We have a number, \\(x\\). The square roots of \\(x\\) are the numbers which, when squared, equals \\(x\\). This square root, call it \\(y\\), is the solution to \\[y^2 = x.\\]

There's only one square root of zero (which is zero itself). There are no [real](real-numbers.md "Real numbers, that is.") square roots for negative numbers. There are two square roots for every other positive number.

We write \\(\sqrt{x}\\) to represent the *positive* square root of \\(x\\). The other root would be \\(-\sqrt{x}\\).

To write both possible roots, we use the **plus or minus** sign to get \\(\pm\sqrt{x}\\).
