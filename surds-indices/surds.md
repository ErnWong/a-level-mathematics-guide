# Surds

**Surds** are [irrational](irration-numbers "Irrational Numbers") \\(n\\)th roots.

## What do you mean by that?

Well, consider \\(\sqrt{4}\\). This can be simplified down to an integer, \\(2\\), since \\(2^2=4\\).

Consider \\(\sqrt{9}\\), which simplifies to \\(3\\). What about \\(\sqrt[3]{27}\\)? That simplifies to \\(3\\) as well. Hence, all \\(\sqrt{4}\\), \\(\sqrt{9}\\) and \\(\sqrt[3]{27}\\) are **rational** \\(n\\)th roots.

But what about \\(\sqrt{2}\\)? Can it be boiled down into a rational number? Turns out that it can't. There's a [nice proof](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/ratio-proportion-topic/alg-rational-irrational-numbers/v/proof-that-square-root-of-2-is-irrational "from Khan Academy") too.

So, **surds** are \\(n\\)th roots that cannot be written as a fraction of two integers.

## Example Please

**Square roots** of: \\(2\\), \\(3\\), \\(5\\), \\(6\\), \\(101\\) and anything that is not a square of a rational number (hence *irrational*). These are surds.

**Cube roots** of... well, of every integer that isn't cubes. These are also surds.

**And**... so on.

Did you notice that if the square root of an integer is not an integer, the square root is irrational? Pretty cool, huh?
