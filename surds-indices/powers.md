# Raising Powers

If you multiply a number by four, you add the original number to \\(0\\) four times.

When you **raise a number to the \\(n\\)th power**, you multiply \\(1\\) by the number four times.

We write \\(b^n\\), and say ``\\(b\\) to the power \\(m\\)''. This way of writing is known as [index notation](index-notation.md).

\\[b^n = \underbrace{b \times b \times b \times \dotsb \times b}_n.\\]

## Squares

**Squaring** a number means multiplying itself by itself, so the square of \\(x\\) is \\(x^2\\) and we say ``\\(x\\) squared''.

It's useful to see that any number, when squared, will always be positive or zero.

## Cubes

Similarly, **cubing** raises a number to the power of three.

## Naming This Operation

Just as multiplying is called multiplication, raising a number to a power is called **exponentiation**.
