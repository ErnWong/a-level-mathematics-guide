# Types of Numbers

*Some people have their lucky numbers. Some people have numbers which they hate. Some numbers are even colourful to some people.*

We, people, put numbers into categories, just like anny other thing.

However, there are some important categories of numbers you should know:

 - [Integers](integers.md),
 - [Rational Numbers](rational-numbers.md),
 - [Irrational Numbers](irrational-numbers.md), and
 - [Real Numbers](real-numbers.md).

We *group* these numbers using **sets**.
