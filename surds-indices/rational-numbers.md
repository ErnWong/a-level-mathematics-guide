# Rational Numbers

A **rational number** is a number that can be written as a fraction of two [integers](integers.md).

All integers are also rational numbers, because integer \\(x=\frac{x}{1}\\), a *fraction of two integers*.

If the decimal part is finite, or repeats indefinitely, then this number is also a rational number; it can also be written as a fraction of two integers.

## Examples

**Rational numbers**: \\(3\\), \\(\frac{2}{5}\\), \\(-\frac{3}{8}\\), \\(5.64\\), \\(7.123123123123\dotsc\\).

***Not* rational numbers**: \\(\sqrt{2}\approx 1.41421356\dotsc\\), \\(\pi \approx 3.14159265\dotsc\\), \\(e \approx 2.718281828459\dotsc\\). Their decimal part does *not* repeat. They are called [irrational numbers](irrational-numbers.md).

The ``\\(\approx\\)'' sign (above) means ``is approx. equal to'', as opposed to the equal sign.

## Set of Rational Numbers

The set of rational numbers contains every number that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers. We label it with \\(\mathbb{Q}\\) for *quotient*, another way of saying ``*fraction*''.

The [set of integers](integers.md#set-of-integers) is a subset of the set of rational numbers, because \\(\mathbb{Q}\\) contains all integers as well as other numbers.

The set of *positive* rational numbers can be represented with the symbol \\(\mathbb{Q}^+\\).

The set of *negative* rational numbers can be represented with the symbol \\(\mathbb{Q}^-\\).
