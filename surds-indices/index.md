# Chapter 1<br />Surds And Indices

-----


In the beginning, you learnt how to add ``one'' to a number. Three becomes four, four becomes five, and so on. Then you've learnt addition, where you repeat adding 1s to a number.

One day, you learnt that you can repeatedly add a number, which you now know as multiplying:

\\[a \times n = \underbrace{a+a+a+\dotsb+a}_{\text{\\(n\\) times}}\\]

Can you repeat multiplication?

Sure! This is what this chapter's about.
