# Integers

**Integers** are whole numbers, both positive and negative including zero.

Integers do not have a *fractional part* (e.g. doesn't have anything after the decimal point, another way of saying that they are *whole numbers*).

Example: the numbers \\(1\\), \\(5\\), \\(0\\), and \\(-234\\), are all integers, but the numbers \\(2.3\\), \\(\tfrac{4}{5}\\), \\(-\tfrac{3}{11}\\) are not integers.

## Set of Integers

Integers can be grouped together into a **set**. We call this as the **set of integers**, labelled as \\(\mathbb{Z}\\) for the German word *Zahlen* meaning ``numbers''.

\\[\mathbb{Z} = \\{\dotsc, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \dotsc\\}.\\]

If a number, \\(x\\), is an integer, then \\(x \in \mathbb{Z}\\). For example, \\(-4 \in \mathbb{Z}\\) because negative four is an integer.

If \\(x\\) is *not* an integer, then \\(x \notin \mathbb{Z}\\). For example, \\(\tfrac{1}{3}\notin\mathbb{Z}\\) because a third is not a whole number. Also, \\(\text{donkey}\notin\mathbb{Z}\\) because a donkey is not even a number!
