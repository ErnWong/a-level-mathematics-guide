# \\(n\\)th Roots

Guess what? An **\\(n\\)th root** \\(x\\) is a number which when raised to the [\\(n\\)th power](powers.md), gives \\(x\\) back! Just like [square roots](square-roots.md) and [cube roots](cube-roots.md).

We write the *positive* \\(n\\)th root of \\(x\\) as \\(\sqrt[n]{x}\\).

It's nice to note that if \\(n\\) is even, then both \\(\sqrt[n]{x}\\) and \\(-\sqrt[n]{x}\\) are its \\(n\\)th roots. If \\(n\\) is odd, then \\(\sqrt[n]{x}\\) is the only [real](real-numbers.md "I mean one that is a real number.") root.
