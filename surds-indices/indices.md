# Index Notation

Index notation is a way of writting powers.

> Note: the plural of index is indices

Using index notation,
\\[\underbrace{a \times a \times a \times \dotsb \times a}_{\text{\\(m\\) times}} = a^m \,,\\]
where \\(a\\) is the **base**, and \\(m\\) is the **index** (also known as the *exponent* and the *power*).

We say ``\\(a\\) to the power \\(m\\)'', or just ``\\(a\\) to the \\(m\\)'' to compact things a bit.
