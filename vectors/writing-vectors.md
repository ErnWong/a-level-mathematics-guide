# Writing Vectors

We can call vectors anything really, like vector \\(x\\), vector \\(cat\\), or even ``that big vector''.

**However**, we normally use **bold** letters to write vectors, when we refer them as single letters.

For example, for speed we might write \\(v\\) while for velocity we might write \\(\mathbf{v}\\).

When we're writing them on paper, it's quite hard to write bold letters, so we either **underline** the letter or draw a small **arrow** above the letter, like \\(\underline{\mathrm{v}}\\) and \\(\vec{v}\\).

> Note: I personally prefer writing \\(\vec{v}\\), as it's standard, but apparently the cambridge examinations prefer bold, and hence the underline as well.
