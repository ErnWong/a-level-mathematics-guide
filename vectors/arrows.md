# Visualising Vectors as Arrows

Arrows are nice; we can use arrows to represent [vectors](magnitude-direction.md).

The length of the arrow represents the magnitude, while the direction of the arrow represents the direction.

For example, a cat sits on a fence, but a while later it moved \\(3\\) metres to the right.

We can draw an arrow from the cat's original location to its new location.
