# Vectors Have a Magnitude and a Direction

A **vector** describes a **magnitude** and a **direction**.

## What's Magnitude?

A **magnitude** is a number, describing the *size* of something. It does not describe any direction.

``A car is travelling \\(80 \text{km}/\text{h}\\).''

This information, ``\\(80 \text{km}/\text{h}\\),'' is not a vector because it doesn't describe it's **direction**.

The ``\\(80 \text{km}/\text{h}\\)'' is a **magnitude**, which in this case is called ``speed''.

----

If instead, we said ``The car is travelling \\(80 \text{km}/\text{h}\\) *east*'', then this information is a **vector**, because we've described both the direction in which the car travels and the magnitude of how fast it travels.

This vector in this case is called ``velocity''. Speed is only a magnitude, but velocity is a vector. Speed is the magnitude **of** the velocity.

## Quick! More Examples!

Moving \\(5 \mathrm{m}\\) is not a vector.

Moving, to the right, is not a vector.

Moving \\(5 \mathrm{m}\\) *to the right* is a vector.

``\\(5 \mathrm{m}\\)'' is the magniude.

``to the right'' is the direction.

----

How much you weigh is not a vector.

``Remote control is a metre away'' does not describe a vector.

``Remote control is in front of me'' does not describe a vector.

``Remote control is a metre in front of me'' describes a vector.

``a metre'' is the magnitude, and ``infront of me'' is the direction.
