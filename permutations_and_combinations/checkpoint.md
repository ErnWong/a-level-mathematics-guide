# Adding Rule â€” Quiz

---


Did you understant the most basic rule, the addition rule of counting? Let's see...

You enter a fast food resturant. There are two menus, menu \\(A\\) and menu \\(B\\), from which there are food choices to choose from. Menu \\(A\\) contains nine different choices, while menu \\(B\\) gives you eleven. Which of the following statements are true?
- [x] By choosing only one of the two menus, and choosing one choice from the selected menu, you have \\(9+11=20\\) possible choices.
- [ ] By choosing one choice from menu \\(A\\), and then another choice from menu \\(B\\), you have \\(9+11=20\\) possible choices.

> Addition rule does not apply if you do *both* processes. It only applies when you do one of either process. In this case, choosing a choice from menu \\(A\\) is one of the processes and choosing a choice from menu \\(B\\) is the other process.
